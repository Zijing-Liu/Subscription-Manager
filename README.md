## Description

<br>

### Project Context

This Subscription Manager application was created as part of the course project for LIBR 559C: Python Programming at the School of Information, University of British Columbia. The project development was completed in 3 weeks in June, 2023. 

<br>

### Background & Objective
As online subscription gain popularity, consumers now face the risk of overspending due to inadequate management of recurring payments. In a survey conducted by [JPMorgan Chase & Co.] (https://media.chase.com/news/survey-from-chase-reveals), 71% the respondents reported wasting over $50 per month on unnecessary recurring payments, 60% had at least once forgotten about their subscriptions, and 55% were unaware of the total expenses they were being charged each month. 

Seeking a fresh start in life where subscriptions work for you, not against you, and where you can enjoy the benefits of subscriptions without the stress?

Our Subscription Manager app is designed for frequent subscription users who have a need of keeping track of subscriptions and cutting down unnecessary expenses. Our app is the go-to-tool for organizing, recording, and visualizing all subscription information in one place. The goal is to help users stay on top of their subscription spending and make more informed financial decisions

### Homepage
Upon reaching the homepage, users will be prompted to select and input the subscription service name, cost, subscription starting date (first billing date), and billing cycle (frequency). By clicking on the "Submit" button, users will be able to create a subscription record, which will capture and store the relevant information provided.

Once on the "Table View" page, users will be able to see an overview of subscription details like subscription name, cost, starting date, billing cycle, and next billing date in tabular format. 

Under the tabular data, users are presented with two button options: "Remove subscription" and "Edit subscription".
